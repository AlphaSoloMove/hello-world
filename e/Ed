activated to add "Hello World" text to the current buffer. Use ed with
-p option to specify the interactive prompt as a colon (:). Press a and Enter
to append text to the current document then in the new line write "Hello World"
and Enter. Mark completion by entering a period (.) by itself in a new line.
Now to print the entire document press comma (,) and p.
',' or '%' is a shorthand for "1,$" range specifier.

	      ed -p :
          :a
          Hello World
          .
          :,p
          Hello World
          :q

- Whitespace is largely insignificant, but these must be the last five
- lines in the file to work properly. Unless it is in "vi: ... :" or
- "ex: ... :" format, any preceeding text will be ignored.

The full documentation for ed is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If the
info and ed programs are properly installed at your site, the command
	      info ed
should give you access to the complete manual.
